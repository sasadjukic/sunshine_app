<strong>ABOUT</strong><br>
<br>
Sunshine is a lightweight, minimalist weather app that packs a few good features

<strong>FEATURES</strong><br>
- The app opens up with the default 4 cities, their current forecast, and temperature
- Clicking the weather icon user is taken to the 3-day forecast for that city
- Clicking on any of the cities' name the user can switch the cities on the fly
- Clicking on the unit of temperature in the upper left of the navbar the user can switch displayed temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit
- By registering, the user can set his own dashboard, entering his home-city and three other favorite cities to track, as well as preferred unit of temperature(C/F) 
- The users can see their own dashboard once they login
- The users can update their dashboard at any time by clicking the "update"
- Once logged out, the app goes back to the default 4 cities

<strong>MISSING</strong><br>
- While the app features two basic error pages(404, 500) some of the error(and general) messages are ommited
- If a user tries to change a city on the fly(by clicking the city name) and enters a non-existant city, nothing will happen. The app will just keep the current city.
- When a user registers for the app, the app redirects to the login page without "success" message to the user
- When a user logs in, the app redirects to the user dashboard without "success" message

<strong>PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES</strong><br>
- Python/Flask for backend
